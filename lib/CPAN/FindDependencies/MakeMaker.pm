=head1 NAME

CPAN::FindDependencies::MakeMaker - retrieve dependencies specified in Makefile.PL's

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Dependencies are also specified in Makefile.PL files used with the ExtUtils::MakeMaker module.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item getreqs_from_mm

Expects the contents of a Makefile.PL as a string.

Returns a hash reference of the form:

    {
        Module::Name => 0.1,
        ...
        Last::Module => 9.0,
    }

=head1 SECURITY

This module assumes that its input is trustworthy and can be safely
executed.  The only protection in place is that a vague attempt is made
to catch a Makefile.PL that just sits there doing nothing - either if it's
in a loop, or sitting at a prompt.  But even that can be defeated by
an especially naughty person.

=head1 BUGS/LIMITATIONS

Makefile.PLs that have external dependencies/calls that can fatally die will
not be able to be successfully parsed and then scanned for dependencies, e.g.
libwww-perl.5808.
