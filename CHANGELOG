- Stop leaking filehandles, so it should still work even when we're not allowed
  to have many open files.

3.09    2021-07-14

                          switched off either);
                        Support multiple CPAN mirrors;
                        CPAN indices are only cached for three minutes instead
                          of for the life of your process;
                        maxdepth 0 now works;

2.46    2016-09-21      Increase timeout for running Makefile.PL, to
                          cope with really slow machines with pitiful
                          I/O

2.45    2016-09-07      No functional changes, bump the required version
                          of YAML::Tiny to cope with some modern META.yml
                          files

2.44    2015-07-21      No functional changes, just fixing tests which

                          by LWP::Simple::get being too damned clever
                          for its own good

2.34    2010-05-29      Parallel testing didn't work on Windows;
                        SKIP if Makefile.PL times out but shouldn't have

2.33    2010-03-12      Optionally report on required module versions

2.32    2009-04-27      Make sure we always chdir() back again in Makefile.PL
                          handler, even if Bad Juju happens, see reports
                          3755239 and 3761690

2.31    2009-04-24      Update version dependency on Parse::CPAN::Packages
                          to avoid a bug in its interaction with the latest

                          not exist, but wasn't being used anyway.  Thanks
                          to Andreas Koenig

2.2     2009-04-14      Add stuff to see 'recommended' modules, thanks to

2.0     2007-12-13      Add caching;
                        Uses cached data for testing, so tests are less
                          fragile;
                        Add maxdepth param

1.99_01 2007-12-03      This version was a re-write;

                        Switch to Parse::CPAN::Packages from CPAN.pm;
                        Much better core module detection;
                        Perl version option;
                        Added docs to cpandeps script

1.1     2007-11-07      Error checking in 'cpandeps' script
