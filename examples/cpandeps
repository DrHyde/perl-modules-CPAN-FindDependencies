=head1 NAME

cpandeps - show a module on the CPAN's dependency tree.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is a simple wrapper around CPAN::FindDependencies.

Given a module name and optionally a version of perl, this program
will show you the module's dependency tree, excluding anything that
is core in the version of perl that you specified.  If you don't
specify a version of perl, it makes the same assumptions as
CPAN::FindDependencies.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    cpandeps CPAN::FindDependencies 5.8.8
