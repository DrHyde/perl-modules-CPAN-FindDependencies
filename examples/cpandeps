=head1 NAME

cpandeps - show a module on the CPAN's dependency tree.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is a simple wrapper around CPAN::FindDependencies.

Given a module name, this program will show you the module's
dependency tree.  It takes exactly the same arguments as the
C<finddeps> function of CPAN::FindDependencies, with the exception
that C<nowarnings> is turned *on* by default.

It shows the module name, its distribution, and if any warnings were
raised (such as if a module's dependencies couldn't be fetched) this
is indicated with an asterisk before the module's name.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    cpandeps CPAN::FindDependencies

    cpandeps CPAN::FindDependencies perl 5.8.8 cachedir ../foo/bar
