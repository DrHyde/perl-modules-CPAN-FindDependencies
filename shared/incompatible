=head1 INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

Up to version 2.49 you used the C<02packages> argument to specify where a
cached C<02packages.details.txt.gz> could be found. That argument no longer
exists as of version 3.00, use the C<mirror> argument instead.

In version 2.49 you used the C<configreqs> argument to specify that you were
interested in configure-time requirements as well as build- and run-time
requirements. That option no longer exists as of version 3.00, it will always
report on configure, build, test, and run-time requirements.
