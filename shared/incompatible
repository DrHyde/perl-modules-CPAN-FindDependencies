=head1 INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

Up to version 2.49 you used the C<02packages> argument to specify where a
cached C<02packages.details.txt.gz> could be found. That argument no longer
exists as of version 3.00, use the C<mirror> argument instead.

Up to version 2.49, C<maxdepth =E<gt> 0> would incorrectly return the whole
tree. From version 3.00 it cuts the tree off at its root so will only return
the module that you asked about. Not very useful, but correct.

In version 2.49 you used the C<configreqs> argument to specify that you were
interested in configure-time requirements as well as build- and run-time
requirements. That option no longer exists as of version 3.00, it will always
report on configure, build, test, and run-time requirements.
