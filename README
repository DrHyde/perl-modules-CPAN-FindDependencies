This module provides tools to find a module's dependencies (and their
dependencies, and so on) without having to download the modules in
their entirety.

To install, do the usual dance:
    less Makefile.PL
    less lib/CPAN/FindDependencies.pm
    less t/*
those being to ensure that I'm not being evil.

then do this to install the module:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install (you may need to do this as root)
